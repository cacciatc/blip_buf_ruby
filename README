*blip_buf_ruby*

This is an FFI extension for the Blip_Buf library which can be found here:
http://code.google.com/p/blip-buf/


%Setup:
-------

  To get yourself up and running you will need a few things:

required:
-(ffi) Can be easily installed as a gem.
-A Blip_Buf library file which will look something like "libbb.*" (.so,.dll,...)

optional:
-(gosu) The demo_gosu.rb example in the test dir requires gosu to be installed.  Gosu can be installed as a gem.
-(rubyzip) For rake to be able to install goodies.  It can be installed as a gem.
-(rake) With which one can build all the demos.  Without it you will have to change the
require paths in some of the ruby classes.

  The easiest route if you are running on linux, mac, or cygwin is to use rake to install by entering "rake install" within the blip_buf_ruby root directory.  
Rake will then attempt to download and build the Blip_Buf library.  If this does not pan out you will have to take matters into your own capable hands...
Starting with the rake file would probably help too.

%Fun:
-----
  
  With everything in place your adventures could begin with: "rake demo" which will run a demo that generates
a square wave and saves it as a wav file in the same directory.  All other demos can be run in a similiar
manner: 
-demo_fixed
-demo_chip
-demo_gosu.  

Each of the remaining demos also create a wav file except for the gosu demo which will start up a GUI and 
let you make some noise by left clicking and dragging your mouse within the gosu window!


%Licensing:
-----------

-The Blip_Buf library is distributed under the LGPL.

-The demo_log.txt file found in the test dir is included with the Blip_Buf library and also falls
under the LGPL.

-This ruby extension is distrubuted under the MIT license.

-Both license files are included.
